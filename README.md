# Movies Database -ETL

## Overview
This project is based on ETL (extract, transform, and load) data pipeline process
A data pipeline moves data from a source to a destination, and the ETL process creates data pipelines that also transform the data along the way. Analysis is impossible without access to good data, so creating data pipelines is often the first step before any analysis can be performed. Therefore, understanding ETL is an essential skill for data analysis.

## Steps Taken for the ETL process:
Following steps were taken to complete the ETL process:
•	Created an ETL pipeline from raw data to a SQL database.
•	Extract data from disparate sources using Python: Wikipedia and Kaggle in JSON and CSV files.
•	Clean and transform data using Pandas.
•	Use regular expressions to parse data and to transform text into numbers.
•	Load data with PostgreSQL.
